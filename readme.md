## Resources

### Books
- "Real-Time Rendering"
- "Game Engine Architecture"
- "Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics"

### Online Resources
- LearnOpenGL (website)
- GPU Gems series
- Scratchapixel 2.0

### APIs and Libraries to Learn
1. Graphics APIs
   - OpenGL (recommended for learning)
   - Vulkan (advanced)
   - DirectX (Windows-specific)

2. Math Libraries
   - GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
   - DirectXMath

## Development Environment
- C++ as primary language
- Alternative: Rust for systems programming
- Graphics API: Start with OpenGL
- IDE: Visual Studio Code with relevant extensions
- Build system: CMake

## Notes
- Focus on understanding concepts before optimization
- Build small, working projects rather than one big project
- Document your learning process
- Keep code organized and version controlled
- Test concepts individually before integration

## Milestones
